# What is the purpose of my application?
The purpose of my web application is to create a supportive and comprehensive digital platform for new immigrants. This app aims to help them navigate their new environment by providing essential resources and community connections. By offering tools for learning new skills, integrating into the local community, and accessing important services, my app is designed to help immigrants and make their transition smoother and more welcoming to their new environment.

# What business problem or real-world problem am I going to be solving?
Many new arrivals (immigrants) lack sufficient information about the culture, transportation system, and supermarkets in their new environment. This issue makes it difficult for them to adapt to their new society. Implementing this application can help them overcome these challenges and can significantly improve the lives of immigrants, making their journey smoother, more welcoming, and less stressful.

# The website attribute:
## Color Palette
- Primary Colors: Soft blues and greens for a calming, welcoming feel.
- Secondary Colors: Warm tones like oranges and yellows to add energy and highlight important features.
## Images
High-quality photos showing diverse people in community settings
## Logos
The application logo will feature the Coloring Hands with the text " Assistance" and I will use primary colors to maintain cohesion and clarity, paired with a clear and legible font.
## Navigation
Structure: Clear, concise menu items for Home, Learning, Community, and Locations
Positioning: Fixed at the top of the page for easy access.
Mobile-Friendly: navigation collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens

# User Story Mapping

# My research results are as follows:
- [International Institude website] https://www.iistl.org
the above link belongs to the International Institute website which assists new immigrants and refugees in different aspects, this website has an event part that I like and I decided to add this feature to my website in the future.
While I appreciate the website's content, the fonts used in this website don't look good and I don't like it
I have tried that users to be more involved in making the website content and materials and I have provided a user live chat that allows users to make new friends and groups, and this makes a difference.
